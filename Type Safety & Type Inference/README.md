# Type Safety
A unique aspect of Swift is that it strongly enforces **Type Safety**, which ensures that no variables are passed with values that incorrect types.
Say we declare a *greeting* variable with a type **String**, you will not be able to reassign that variable with an **Int** value.
# Type Inference
**Type Inference** plays a part in Swift as well. Type inference is the process where, if you do not explicitly define the **Type Annotation** for variable, the compiler will scan through your code and define it automatically.
