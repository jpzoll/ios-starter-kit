What does **location** do in a radial gradient?
Location refers to the starting point for each color in the gradient. If two colors share the same location, then there will be no visual gradient and instead an immediate switch to the next color (i.e if both locations are 0.3. If one location is 0.3 and another is 0.4 instead, then there will be a gradient in between 0.3 and 0.4 on the screen.)
